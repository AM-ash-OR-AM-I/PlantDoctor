    "Potato___Early_blight": "Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems. Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry. For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.",
    "Potato___Late_blight": "Plant resistant cultivars when available. Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation. Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation. Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest",
    "Tomato___Early_blight": "Use pathogen-free seed, or collect seed only from disease-free plants. Rotate out of tomatoes and related crops for at least two years. Control susceptible weeds such as black nightshade and hairy nightshade, and volunteer tomato plants throughout the rotation. Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus. Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry. Stake the plants to increase airflow around the plant and facilitate drying. Staking will also reduce contact between the leaves and spore-contaminated soil.",
    "Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus":  "The most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. Symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost. ",
    "Tomato___Bacterial_spot": "Using pathogen-free seed and disease-free transplants, when possible, is the best way to avoid bacterial spot on tomato. Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and cull piles near greenhouse or field operations, and rotating with a nonhost crop also helps control the disease.",
    "Tomato___Leaf_Mold": "Upon noticing the infected areas, the first step is to let the plants air out and dry. If they are being cultivated in a greenhouse, expose them to dry air conditions, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive and thrive is dried up in the open air. If the tomatoes are being cultivated outdoors, try to keep the leaves dry when watering the plants. One thing you can do to help keep the leaves as dry as possible is to water in the early morning hours, that way the plant has plenty of time to dry before the sun comes out, which will keep the humidity around the leaves low. You can also try drip irrigation methods, or soak watering methods to attempt to water the soil without ever wetting the leaves of the plant.",
    "Tomato___Target_Spot" : "Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores. Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year– primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course– tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil." ,
    "Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite" : "The best way to begin treating for two-spotted mites is to apply a pesticide specific to mites called a miticide. Ideally, you should start treating for two-spotted mites before your plants are seriously damaged. Apply the miticide for control of two-spotted mites every 7 days or so. Since mites can develop resistance to chemicals, switch to another type of miticide after three applications.",
    "Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus" : "The use of ToMV-resistant varieties is generally the best way to reduce losses from this disease. Avoid planting in soil from previous crops that were infected with ToMV. Steam sterilizing the potting soil and containers as well as all equipment after each crop can reduce disease incidence. Before handling containers or plants be sure all workers wash with soap and water. Sterilizing pruning utensils or snapping off suckers without touching the plant instead of knife pruning help reduce disease incidence. Direct seeding in the field can help reduce the spread of ToMV.",
    "Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot" : "Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands and pruners thoroughly before working with uninfected plants. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil).",
    "Tomato___Late_blight" : "Plant resistant cultivars when available. Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation. Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation. Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest. Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.",
    "Cherry___Powdery_mildew" : "Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground. Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves. Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days. Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors.",
    "Pepper___Bacterial_spot": "Seed treatment with sodium hypochlorite (for example, Clorox) is effective in reducing bacterial populations on seed surfaces. Control of bacterial spot on greenhouse transplants is an essential step for preventing spread of the leaf spot bacteria in the field. Transplants should be inspected regularly to identify symptomatic seedlings. Transplants with symptoms may be removed and destroyed or treated with streptomycin. Products containing microorganisms can be used to enhance plant growth and reduce the negative effects of diseases. These products may contain plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) or biological agents"
